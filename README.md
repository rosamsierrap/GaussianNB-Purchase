# Naive Bayes Implementation

In this project, the Sklearn Library was used as a key tool for implementing the Naive Bayes Classification model. The primary focus was on addressing two distinct tasks:

* Task1: Predicting customer decisions regarding computer purchases based on profile variables

* Task2: Predicting outdoor play based on weather conditions.
